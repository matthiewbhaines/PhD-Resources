Things I wish I knew/had starting my PhD that would have made life easier.

## Books
[Project Management for the Unooficial Project Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Unofficial-Manager-Updated/dp/1637740506/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1VDIVSCZCMBTL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cE6JVsp9i0nFc2OEGBDPWIduwUB57JK3zUeKuJTIQppoCKzN1tCblLsxm68ACQZy-cZj2bPHWoDeBeJmnEC1V6oEM-Ztb8xDDk5qsgAHbY_vknhh4Jzm6IlkBrHX9PwaHKQ7AMPqMvR-DSOrCQUdjOqTHUOKsX1Z4_tYKUENJzCyAYt78wgvwsUej6bhCz8Jrl9TyDug4B4W5LmzF_EqaBGSMM8IZiRPi_hTf1ywqA4.i9HjNP5a2SfkOO0HsHrlmzahjm_mbWkkzxeeppv0_7g&dib_tag=se&keywords=project+management+for+the+unofficial+project+manager&qid=1739470332&sprefix=project+management+%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-1)
- An experiment/study for your PhD is just a project with a staff of one (you!).

[Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DDDE7T8D828&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JPu08UYkU4zwl38D65fqtO63gughA0c6JaxyWZxIA8kHzHm2gqWKl4DfZHT5ZZGFq1qlWF3QJbmjvT295aCgiUBkYLuOcrrzc0K1kQE6k4B0vAdv65XkA1dwuGezhMg2vdh1teadM-uoiKui9zWJqSpu47uOHdVavZ_c1cVjvrBvkJiloGCOKBYeIOa4r5lIl4Y125hJgkbWuaCuKyQH-LW_aU3hqVR5-KRwMI7L8zU.6f2rNcDfJeDWFplIMhz0PjCjFmN8wuHxBGzaUOEcz3k&dib_tag=se&keywords=getting+things+done&qid=1739470433&sprefix=Getting+things+%2Caps%2C185&sr=8-1)
- A must read.
- Create a system for containing thoughts and tasks in a streamlined way.
- The updated edition utilises computer technology, would totally work on a paper system too

[How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Technique/dp/3982438802/ref=sr_1_1?crid=21DTGCLRWS41X&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YBwST8cgh8_L-Bvv5mf6aApHS5CUjqw2oXJGEoAQjjBNnSvOnuNvWH7qZv_55NI_Q6JSX9A5qRpkrV0-wAzurSwgg-ffEo-1rsxddTTQnv4gyqfU1JY2U20WXMJttFKvHIQkQIGWh7kEYoAbT3Y9rA.eXTiNIeRmEtS_HzvU6nBANR7BeGNXrskvMRaPjisB1c&dib_tag=se&keywords=how+to+take+smart+notes+s%C3%B6nke+ahrens&qid=1739470524&sprefix=how+to+take+sma%2Caps%2C220&sr=8-1)
- I borrowed this from the Columbus Library and ended up purchasing my own copy (on Kindle) so I can reference it when I stray from my Zettelkasten system
- I find this method of notetaking extremely helpful when reading literature to connect ideas, concepts, and results. My own Zettelkasten system (using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)) has developed over the years. Great place for keeping a bibliography too.

## Websites
[Cal Newport, PhD](calnewport.com)
- Dr. Cal Newport is a Georgetown professor in Computer Science. He understands what is needed to get a PhD and be successful as an academic. His books (Deep Work, Slow Productivity, and So Good They Can't Ignore You) are also great resources.

[James Hayton, PhD](https://phd.academy/blog/)
- I found Dr. Hayton giving a (seminar)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM6orL-bGDc&t=575s] which helped develop my sense of academic writing (particularly the introduction)
- His (YouTube channel)[https://www.youtube.com/@James_Hayton] has *tons* of videos. I find his writing and stress-management material particularly useful

[Susan Johnson, MD](https://thrivingamidstchaos.com/)
- Susan gave a seminar in the first year of my PhD, giving rise to most of these websites and books that have helped me over the years. I am so grateful to her for her mentorship and guidance.
